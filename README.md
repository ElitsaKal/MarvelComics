Here we explore the publicly available Marvel comic book data base and use RegEx to extract meaningful information from the text data. 
1. We start by loading the csv data file
2. We want to find out what the most common Marvel names are in titles, descriptions and comic book names.
3. We refine our search by adding hyphoneted words as one, instead of splitting them
4. We want to find out who the most prolific writers of comic books are
5. We refine our search by including active years in chronological order
6. Finding patterns in comic book descriptions with a top 20 most used words
7. We extend this to the top 50 words
